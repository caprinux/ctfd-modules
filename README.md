# CTFd Modules Plugin

CTFd Modules is a plugin built for CTFd.

The main purpose of this is to better organize challenges which would be useful when CTFd is used as a training platform.

**This plugin is HIGHLY experimental and has not been tested. Use at your own risk.**


## TODOs

- Fix redirect to the old /challenges page
- Support images for modules so that the modules page is more aesthetic
- Ensure that automated tools like CTFCLI can still work with this
- Rewrite assets which is currently copied from CTFd
